		instead of the average (the highest value of the average value). It is not available for low mem devices.
		It can also be used in graphic elements.
	*	new value Watt per kg/pound, Watt per kg/pound NP. You will have to enter a weight in the settings!
		Watt per kg/pound NP: watt taken from normalized power, so a element with normalized power has to exist in the layout (value is taken from there)!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8.3	(datafield only)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8.2
	*	Heading can now be displayed as text ($T) (8-wind compass rose), or normal as degrees ($V)

	* 	new logo
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.7.5
	*	changed black/white switching: removed the default black config string. 
		Instead every element can be set to be included in b/w switching. When it is included, the color of this element will be inverted when
		switched to black background.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.7.4
	*	changed error text when using wrong designer version for creating string
	*	a workout step is now registered as lap event
	*	fixed bugs: (hiding not working, app version, name not shown)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.7.3
	*	resized element list in the designer
	* 	a dynamic color value can now be set to blink (1s interval) (B Checkbox next to the dynamic color values)
	*	increased max value for a dynamic color value to 1048576
	*	fixed a problem when parsing a string which is too long
	*	last lap avg speed, current lap avg. speed, average speed elapsed, temperature are now converted correctly to imperial.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.7.0
	*	config string is now versionized to avoid incompatible strings in the future (version starts with 'A')
	*	fixed time format replacing when text is in front of format string
	*	changed unit of pressure from pascal to hectopascal
	*	Shortcut for 'Append' has changed to Ctrl+I
	*	Elements in the right preview window are now clickable. The element will then be selected in the element list and highlighted shortly.
	*	Ctrl + Left/Right/Up/Down can now be used to move elements in the preview (changes X/Y).
		Shift + Left/Right/Up/Down changes X2/Y2 of the element
	*	added auto repeat for buttons (keeps clicking when mouse button is down)
	*	optimized some variables in datafield
	*	new elements: Distance to coordinate, Direction arrow, Direction triangle (all only for HighMem devices!): x/y define the center of the arrow/triangle, 
					radius defines the length from center of the arrow/triangle (total arrow length is 2x radius), 
					stroke defines thickness of the arrow/triangle. 
					'- Y Offset' defines distance from center so element can rotate on a circular path from center.
					There is a new setting in the config for the datafield -> Coordinates ['Lat.xx, Long.xx' or 'N']
					The setting is used when valuetype of the direction arrow/triangle is set to None.
					There are 3 different ways to use this feature:
						1.	Leave the Coordinate field empty -> the direction arrow shows to the starting point of the activity and the value 'distance to coordinate' shows distance to starting point.
						2.  Enter a coordinate in the format 'Lat.xx, Long.xx' (for example: '47.12345, 15.55667') -> direction arrow/'distance to coordinate' points to this coordinate
						3.	Enter 'N' in the Coordinate field -> direction arrows points always to north. 'distance to coordinate' makes no sense here (shows distance to north pole)
					new values :'Start coordinates', 'North', 'Setting coordinates': Only used for graphic element 'Direction arrow' and 'Direction triangle': 
					But if valuetype of the 'Direction arrow/triangle' is set to either 'Start coordinates', 'North' or 'Setting coordinates' 
					it will point to this valuetype
	*	new values: VAM current avg: there are two VAM values now available, the "VAM total avg" and the "VAM current avg".
		"VAM total avg": shows the average Ascent/h over the whole activity
		"VAM current avg": "nr of values" has to be set to your liking. If you set it to, for example 30 then this values shows the average VAM over the last 30 seconds.
							a "nr of values" of 1 does not really make sense because the value jumps too much to be usesful.
		version number, appname, phone connected (0: disconnected, 1: connected)
		changed "Clock time" to "Current date/time". $Y is replaced with year(4 digits), $N is replaced with current month(01-12) and $D is replaced with current day(01-31).	* 	because of recent additions I had to change the max number of elements for (M) devices from 60 to 50.
		derailleur front, rear
	*	new values: support for following ANT+ device types: BikeSpeed, BikeCadence, BikeSpeedCadence, Shifting, 
		BikePower, FitnessEquipment, RunningDynamics, BikeRadar and LightningNetwork devices
		for every device there is also a status and a battery value available:
		status: 0: dead, 1: closed, 2: searching, 3: tracking
		battery: 1: new, 2: good, 3: OK, 4: low, 5: critical, 7: invalid
	 	ant device state and battery state can be shown as text as well(just replace $V with $T) (value is still stored, so dyn colors can be used)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5.2
	*	added check in designer when device is switched (valuetypes are reset when switching from a higher memory device to a lower one)
	*	new button "Goto DynCol" in designer. When pressed the selection jumps to the according dynamic color in the element list
	*	Valuetype dropdown now only shows available values for the selected device, not all as before
	*	Element list is now colored
	*	Improved element highlighting in designer
	*	Added element info field in designer
	*	switched to CIQ 3.1.8

	*	Fixed problem with flickering in designer
	*	fixed "Time to dest (avg. sp)" showing wrong value
	*	odometer value is now written on timer reset (when activity is saved)
	*	new values: TSS ("Norm b. pow." needs to be in the layout and FTP has to be set in the settings!), 
		min, max altitude,  min,max,avg gradient (starts at 30s after timer start), VAM(TotalAscent(m)*3600/TimerTime(s))
		(note that for min,max,avg gradient values the value gradient has to be in the layout. Also nr_of_values of min,max,avg gradient should be 1)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.4
	*	NP calculation now also pauses when activity is paused
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.3
	*	it is now possible to set a dynamic color value to be hidden. Instead of setting the color for this element when it is in the value range, the element will be hidden.
	*   maximum value for dynamic color value is now 262144
	*	normalized power starts to be calculated 30s after activity start.
	*   made the sample text for the elements in the designer changable
	*	XML File is now saved with BOM for better UTF8 compatibility
	* 	it is now possible to add different layouts for black and white background color.
		be aware because of memory issues the check for background color is only done when 
		datafield is opened, it is not changed dynamically at the moment.
	*	fixed "Time to next p. (avg. sp)" showing wrong value
	*	fixed wrong arc degrees when pressing "Scale for device" button in designer
	*   added fontmapping for vivoactive4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.2 (datafield only)
	*	fixed a bug where the datafield crashed when device did not have power values available
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.1
	*	fixed a crash when using current lap power/hr, and values are now updated only after timer start
	*	temperature can now be displayed an all devices which support temperature
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.9	
	*	dynamic colors now accept also zero and negative values
		the value field of the color has now to be empty to ignore it (not 0 anymore!)
	*	capping of pace value is now configurable in the settings of the datafield (default is 599 (= 9:59min))
		for no capping just set to zero or leave empty
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.8 (datafield only!)
	*	little memory optimization when not using a single element with nr_of_values greater than 30 (saves some bytes)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.7
	* 	switched to new SDK 3.1.7
	*	it is now possible to enter more than one pacer distance seperated by ';'. 
		Multiple pacer distances only make sense when using target pace 'PX:YY'!
	*	new values: time/% in power zone. 
		Power zones must be set in datafield settings! ('100;150;200;250;300;350;400') 7 Values -> 6 Zones
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.6
	*	coordinates in designer are now updated in the fields as well when pressing coord shortcut
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.5
	* 	new value: total pause time
	*	hr zone times are now reset correctly
	*	2 new shortcuts:
		Ctrl+Shift+A sets the current cursor coordinates to x/y of the current selected element
		Ctrl+Shift+Y sets the current cursor coordinates to x2/y2 of the current selected element
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.4 (datafield only)
	*	hr zones can now have decimals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.3
	*	added coordinate information in designer
	*	added keyboard shortcuts:
		"Load" - Ctrl+O
		"Save" - Ctrl+S
		"Append" - Ctrl+P
		"Save as" - Ctrl+Shift+S
		"Copy to clipboard" - Ctrl+B
	*	new values: time/% in heartrate zone
	*	added some safety checks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.2
	*	fixed a bug in the designer where color rectangles were not updated when value changed in editfield.
	*	corrected time format when no seconds are used ($H:$M)
	*	memory, memory, memory. Everytime I take a look in the code I find some parts I can optimize to save memory and performance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.1
	*	new values: 
		*	Curr Lap avg power w/ zeros. 'Curr Lap avg power' does not include zeros now!
		*	%FTP (FTP needs to be set in the settings, because SDK does not provide this value!)
	*	values with an average over 30s are now stored more efficiently.
		If 'nr of values' is greater than 30 they should be a multiple of 30 (60, 90, ...)! If not, they will be rounded to the next lower multiple of 30.
	*	'Curr Lap avg power' and 'Curr Lap avg heartrate' are now stored more efficiently. 
		Maximum lap duration is 2 hours for these values. If the lap exceeds 2 hours the value only shows the average over last 2 hours!
	*	Fixed a bug in the designer, where the little color fields where not updated.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.0
	*	new value: pacer current ahead time.
		Renamed pacer ahead time to pacer target ahead time.
	*	max value for displayed pace is now 9:59 for min/km and 19:59 for min/mi
	*	Pacer ahead time writing to fit file is now optional. 
		If enabled, both pacer ahead times writing takes about 800 bytes of space after timer start. By default it is disabled.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.8
	*	new values: current lap, last lap avg power, current lap, last lap avg heartrate (high mem devices only!)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.7
	*	total distance is now stored as integer not float.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.6
	*	refreshing of the graphics area reworked
		I tried to minimize flickering, so graphics are only updated in the region they are changing. Text changes will still trigger complete redraw.
		There is still little flickering left, and I know its not the perfect solution, but it should be better as before I hope.
		Because I changed a little more code, please let me know if there is anything wrong when changing elements or just the preview is not updated
		correctly anymore.
	*	New element: -seperator-
		This is a dummy element and will not be exported. It can be used to group the elements so they are easier to find in the element list.
		It is just displayed in the element list, text can be changed of course.
		
		There are no functional changes, so you can use the previous version of the designer if something is completely wrong, which I hope isn't.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.5
	*	new value: Odometer
		Value is stored in the settings in meters! The displayed value is km or mi. Value will be written to the settings when
		the activity is stopped.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.4
	*	new graphic element: arc dyn. filled
		It is the same like the rectangle dyn. filled but as arc of course. The end angle will be
		reduced by current value of the element. I added a example in the examples.zip - 935/dynamic_arc_test.xml
		The first two arcs in the example are drawn in opposite directions!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.2
	*	added support for imperial units.
	*	some more memory optimizations
	*	new graphic element: arc
		Start angle is the 3 o'clock position. Direction is clockwise
	* 	new value: free memory
		Because I cannot predict how much free memory there is, I added the field
		to show a roughly estimate how much memory is free during testing of your layout. 
		There should be at least 200 bytes free after starting the timer.
		Be aware that using the pacer will use about 800 bytes more after starting the timer!!
		How to use: Just place the textfield anywhere visible on your layout, copy the layout to your device, open the datafield and start the timer.
		If there is at least 300 bytes left after some minutes, your are on the save side. You can then remove the text field from your layout of course.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.9 (datafield only)
	* 	fixed bug causing a crash when timer was reset
	*	fixed crash caused of division by zero
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.8
	* 	fixed bug for edge explore
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.7
	*	new graphic elements: rectangle horizontal filled, rectangle vertical filled.
		These elements only work with dynamic colors. The first and last value of a dynamic color defines
		the range of the rectangle. So, for example if the values in the dynamic color range from 100 to 50 and
		the current value of the element is 75 then the rectangle is only drawn half (either horizontal or vertical).
		(In the designer the values are multiplied by 10 of course!)
		The dynamic color is also applied. See examples.zip -> 935/example_dynamic_rectangle.xml
	*	new value: temperature
		Current max elements:    low mem devices: 22
							  medium mem devices: 43
							    high mem devices: 500
	*	fixed coloring bug for graphic elements with low memory devices
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.4
	*	added some security checks to avoid crashes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.3
	*	added pacer fields (see description below!)
	*	fonts.txt adjusted for Fenix6X Pro
	*	added max element check for all devices, to avoid running out of memory.
Pacer:	There are new settings for the pacer available on all devices except the CIQ1 (16kb) ones.
		Available fields:
		*	Pacer calc average speed: This field is mandatory when using pacer because all pacer calculations are based on this field.
			It just needs to be in the layout, it can be hidden in the background.
			The "nr of values" must be set to a value multiple of 30. This value defines in which timerange the
			current average speed is calculated and the ahead/behind time and predicted time are base on the already 
			reached distance and this average speed. In my example file it is set to 300 (5mins).
		*	Pacer ahead time: Shows the ahead/behind time based on the settings.
		*	Pacer predicted time: Shows the finish time based on already elapsed distance and average speed over last XX seconds/minutes.
		*	Pacer predicted pace: Calculated finish pace based on above values
		*	Pacer total average pace: Current total average based including corrected distance(see below)
		*	Pacer corrected distance: Shows the current elapsed distance including the offset value (lap button press, see below)
		*	Pacer offset indicator: This graphic element (in my example a little yellow circle) is only shown when a distance offset value is set by lap button press (see below).

		Settings: 
			*	Pacer distance: distance in km:
				-> '21.1' (for a half marathon)
			*	Pacer target time/pace: the target time or target pace:
				target time -> 'T2:05:05' (for 2h 05mins 05sec target time)
				or target pace -> 'P5:30' (for a target pace of 5:30 min/km)
		Distance correction:	It is possible to press the lap button at a km marker during a race. The distance is then rounded to the nearast kilometer 
								and "Pacer total average pace" and "Pacer corrected distance" are corrected. (5.1km corrects to 5.0km; 3.84km corrects to 4.0km)
								When correction is active it is indicated by the "Pacer offset indicator" (little yellow circle)
								When lap button is pressed within 30 seconds again, the offset is reset.
		Ahead time and predicted pace are written into the fit file.
		An example layout can be found in the examples.zip -> FR935/example_FR935_pacer.xml
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0.7
	*	complete rework of the config string parsing, thus the string must be created again with new designer version!
	*	fonts.txt adjusted for Fenix3 and FR945, Fenix6.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.4
	* 	corrected crash for low memory devices like FR235, FR630. They can handle about 5-6 elements now. 
		But memory is still very tight on this devices!
	*	GPS high acc indicator checks also for gps accuracy > 3 not only the current speed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.3 (designer only)
	* 	error message is now only shown once in a redraw loop, not for every element
	*	default color of a dynamic color is now 123456 not 000000 to avoid getting a error message for every fixed text with color 000000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.2
	*	fixed MTB gear calculation.
	*	MTB gear is now updated even when no activity is started.
	*	new value: current pause time
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.1
	*	NP values are now reset correctly after restart
	*	check to avoid crash when using distancetoX, power fields on devices which dont support these values
	*	new value: GPS high acc indicator: This values is set to 1 the first time the current speed is under 5 km/h.
		Because GPS still jumps around at the beginning altough it indicates max accuracy I added this indicator.
		When accuracy is still low, a high current speed is displayed even if standing still. So this indicator gets a value of 1 the first time 
		the speed is under 5 km/h, that generally indicates that GPS got a better fix on that position. (see example_FR935_3.xml)
	*	MTB gear calculation: calulates the current gear, depending on following parameters which are entered as text for this value seperated by a semicolon
		(see example file Charts_Edge1030_gear_mcinner1.xml): 220;30;10;12;14;16;18;21;24;28;32;36;42;50
		220: wheel circumference in cm
		30: number of teeth of the front sprocket
		10..50: number of teeth of the rear sprockets
		for example: number of teeth of the rear sprockets: 10 12 14 16 18 21 24 28 32 36 42 50
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.0 (datafield only)
	*	NP calculation now starts at activity start
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.9 (datafield only)
	*	fixed crash when using normalized power
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.8
	*	fixed the max cadence bugfix
	*	corrected wrong conversion when using "adapt" button in the designer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.6
	*	corrected display value for max cadence. Because the value comes from the sdk, the value will still be wrong in the fit file.
	*	new value: normalized bike power, last lap NP, current lap NP (one includes zero values one does not)(only available on devices with at least 64kb memory!).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.5 (datafield only)
	*	version adapted to match clone #2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.3 (datafield only)
	*	lap values are now reset on timer reset callback, not on timer start.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.2
	*	naming in element list changed for better readability
	*	new button "Adapt for device". When switched between devices, the coordinates
		of the elements are adjusted depending on the new resolution of the device
	*	new values: avg speed/pace with elapsed time (no pause)
	*	adapted font mapping for: Edge 1000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.0
	*   new time format value: $c and $C replaces seconds (same as $s and $S). The only difference is that
		the seconds will be hidden, if the string has hours to display, so its keeps the same length.
		$H:$M:$C 	--> 1h23min4s will be shown as 01:23; 
					--> 45min12s will be shown as 45:12
	*	pace is now limited to 9:59 min/km, every value above will be shown as 9:59
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1.9
	*	lap values are now reset on activity start
	*	lap time cannot be smaller than zero anymore
	*	fixed text can now also have a dynamic color
	*	new values: last lap avg pace/speed, current lap avg pace/speed
